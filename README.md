# Minecraft Clone

A from-scratch implementation of Minecraft using C++ and OpenGL.

## Overview

This project aims to replicate core Minecraft features, creating a 3D voxel-based sandbox game with procedural world generation and block-based terrain manipulation.

## Features (Planned)

- **World Generation**: Procedural terrain generation with noise-based algorithms
- **3D Movement**: First-person camera controls and player navigation
- **Block System**: Multiple block types with different properties
- **Building & Destruction**: Place and remove blocks in real-time
- **Terrain Features**: Trees, water, terrain variation, and biome support

## Technologies

- **Language**: C++
- **Graphics API**: OpenGL
- **Build System**: CMake (recommended)
